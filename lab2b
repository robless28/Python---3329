# In your script factorial.py, create a function factorial(n) that takes a non-negative integer n and returns 
# the factorial of that number n.aIt should call this function and ask the user for input in the if __name__ == "__main__": block. 
# Also add input validation and fail gracefully if the user did not input a non-negative integer by printing 
# “Please input a non-negative integer.” to the screen.
